        <h1>Is Space cool?</h1>
        <p>
            Did something happen in the last 5 minutes that suddenly made Space uncool?
            Did we find hostile and scary aliens like the ones in Ender's Game? ... No, then 
            space is still cool. 
        </p>
        <h3>Your Take</h3>
        <p>
            So you have heard of what I think of space, now, lets give you your chance
            to also speak. Comment below, if you agree that space is cool, as well as 
            any thoughts and questions you might have about it.

             Oh ya, some of you might 
            ask if the earth is flat, and my answer is, it is a matter of perspective. To
            someone huge, the earth is a spec of dust, to those on the ISS, the earth is 
            round and big, and to us mortals on the ground, the earth is flat and never ending.
        </p>

            We can do a simple check if it is round, by walking in a straight line and seeing 
            if we arive at the same point, but sadly, our endurance can't make it that long. 
            That is the only thing stopping us, not the ocean or mountains, it is our endurance. 
            Some of you might ask, why not use a machine, and I say, what if the machine is in on 
            it with whtever is trying to dupe us, unless you make the machine by hand, with materials you grew or made 
            yourself, don't trust anything. It seems like someone out there really wants us to 
            believe that it is round, I wonder who, and what do they gain if we believe it.

            a comment, so please do so. I am still disoriented, so I am going to check the logs
            and see what I a missing and need to update.
